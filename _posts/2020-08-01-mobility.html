    <h2>Being Born</h2>
    <p>
        All humans, be they girls or boys, are born<br>
        To move.  For months they will not see the light,<br>
        But they'll insinuate a feeling presence<br>
        Before they darkly wriggle into sight.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Leaving the dubious shelter of the womb,<br>
        Even perhaps before the cord's been sundered<br>
        The wailing child may flap her arms and legs<br>
        A token that as yet no one has blundered.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>The Crawler</h2>
    <p>
        Lying face down the infant soon will show<br>
        That it is not content to stay confined<br>
        In one place; for hands will grasp the bars<br>
        That surround the crib &mdash; the vertical to find.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Place a child upon the floor and watch<br>
        Her try to emulate the serpent's slide<br>
        By using belly combined with frantic limbs<br>
        To crawl to reach whatever it is she's spied.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>The Toddler</h2>
    <p>
        The toddler starts holding parental hands.<br>
        Dithering at first in something of a trance,<br>
        Then balancing, she casts off all restraints,<br>
        And scuttles off without a backward glance.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        This strange requires a careful supervision.<br>
        For her curious mind most quickly turns<br>
        To wonder at the <em>what</em> and <em>how</em> and <em>why</em>,<br>
        Before the child has learned that fire burns.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>Devices</h2>
    <p>
        Walking and running are not enough.  The child,<br>
        By acquisition of a vehicle,<br>
        Fulfils her wish to emulate the grown-ups,<br>
        And like the boy next door she gets a tricycle.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Infancy left well behind finds both boys<br>
        And girls desiring thrills brought on by speed.<br>
        The human powered bicycle gives way<br>
        To motor bike and car, which substitute for toys.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>The Walker</h2>
    <p>
        No!  Chronology has not been cast<br>
        Aside!  My walker is not animated;<br>
        It's just a thing: four wheels mounted fast<br>
        Upon a frame without a warning ding-a-ling.<br>
        Two handles at waist level let me push<br>
        The thing, as in past years I used to wheel<br>
        A pram or stroller.  Nowadays the flush<br>
        Of age allows no moving on an even keel.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        In theory walkers are designed to aid<br>
        A user to move naturally upright,<br>
        And there's the rub, for in reality<br>
        I stoop too much, yet fail to take account<br>
        Of nasty changes in the ground, such as a<br>
        A crumbled kerbstone's dust and sand<br>
        On which I fell down into lulu's land.<br>
    </p>
