    <h2>Prelude</h2>
    <p>
        <i>Et in Arcadia ego</i>
    </p>

    <p>
    Arcady and Eden, gardens sensed<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;As sites of primal innocence<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before experience<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has worked its worse:<br>
    </p>

    <p>
    Such myths raise questions that undermine<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;The rural idyll by reminding<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Us as Vergil did<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of our mortality.<br>

    <h2>The Fylde</h2>
    <p>
    On the bus from Barcelona somewhere<br>
    North of Cordoba the woman next<br>
    To me cried out with joy, ‘¡Ay mí tierra!’<br>
    </p>

    <p>
    More than thirty years have come and gone<br>
    Since I felt her exultation. Vexed<br>
    Am I still by her unspoken question.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
    ‘¿Donde está su tierra?’ The rural Fylde<br>
    Of Lancashire comes first to mind, despite<br>
    The drenching mizzle borne on clouds piled<br>
    By the western winds that render day as night.<br>
    Nostalgia of old age occasionally leads<br>
    Me to evoke green fields and winding lanes,<br>
    Dutch barns, and hear again the whistling speeds<br>
    Of easily remembered express trains.<br>
    A photograph shows boys in sailor suits<br>
    Serving as shy Britannia’s body guard.<br>
    They stand attentive for the photo shoots<br>
    Save one whose posture brands him as ill-starred.<br>
    For two years earlier, his mother died<br>
    And still from time to time for her he cried.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>Holderness</h2>
    <p>
    Pre-Norman names – Amounderness and Holderness<br>
    Denote the leap I made from west to east<br>
    To go to college, where a war time army camp<br>
    Of Nissen huts surrounded by a wood<br>
    Did duty for a hall of residence.<br>
    Unpropitious as this sounds I look<br>
    Back fondly on my four years spent in <i>Camp</i><br>
    <i>Hall</i> Cottingham, three miles from Hull’s<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red brick college.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
    A skiving student, I achieved<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;A kind of education<br>
    Watching foreign films,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Quite free from condemnation.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
    Spare-time cycling gave much pleasure<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;In a landscape of green plains<br>
    Wolds and medieval churches<br>
    Before the poet Larkin biked its lanes.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
    The much-bombed city being then restored<br>
    Revealed its past of worthy sons –<br>
    Andrew Marvell and Wilberforce –<br>
    And memorable sites – the plotting parlour<br>
    Of the old White Hart, the counting houses<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the River Hull<br>
    </p>

    <p>
    Eight years after leaving the city<br>
    I lived a while in Withernsea<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, made Holderness<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A possible contender<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the quest to find my land.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>Market Rasen</h2>
    <p>
    Not long after my first marriage<br>
    And first teaching post, I gave<br>
    The green light to my brother, now<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;A pacifist, to live with us<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;In Lincolnshire where he could work<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;At farming, and so save himself<br>
    From our stepmother’s harassment.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
    Not long after he arrived an amber light<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Began to flash its warning, though<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;I failed to see it blinked for me.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
    As fraternity transformed itself<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Into a would-be fratricide<br>
    This genial landscape leading to the wolds<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Could never be ‘my land’.<br>

    <h2>Suffolk Essex Border</h2>
    <p>
    At last it seemed I’d found a place where life<br>
    Would be much more than merely living day<br>
    To day: good job, a marriage free from strife<br>
    First house bought, a new born to display.<br>
    Here we would become staunch partisans<br>
    Of Labour Party politics, and swell,<br>
    Eventually, the ranks of Ipswich fans,<br>
    And camp abroad lured by the solar spell<br>
    Of Italy or Spain. But yet, despite<br>
    Propitious omens, living in this land<br>
    Would bring me more than one unforeseen fright,<br>
    Until that day which left me quite unmanned,<br>
    As yet a second wife abandoned me.<br>
    For whom or why? I was too blind to see.<br>

    <h2>An Interim, Part One: Judd Street London</h2>
    <p>
    Half-chosen, half compelled I left my post<br>
    In Suffolk, most improbably locating<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;In the <i>Great Wen’s</i> heart.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
    Here my aspiring better half played out<br>
    The spotted play of more than two decades.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;With never a ‘by your leave.’<br>
    </p>

    <p>
    Succoured by a friend, I wallowed hopeless<br>
    As a derelict, until a daughter’s<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Counsel sent me off to Spain.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>An Interim, Part Two: Spain</h2>
    <p>
    TESOL found me in Spain’s holy town<br>
    Where James the saint on his own night conspired<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;With chance to change my life for good.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
    Intoxicated by the fireworks and the crowd<br>
    A transatlantic woman’s voice would work<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;A wonder I could not shake off.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
    In fabled Seville months would pass with air born<br>
    Words, our vehicle of growing love,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Till summer consummated it.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>Boston, Massachusetts</h2>
    <p><i>
    Viola: What country friends is this?<br>
    Sea Captain: This is Illytia lady. (Twelfth Night)<br>
    </i></p>

    <p>
    Not shipwrecked did I chance on this<br>
    Much vaunted land, nor was I shipped<br>
    For sale in sultry markets, fated<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;To toil and to be whipped.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
    Nor was I one of those who fled<br>
    Habitual pogroms of a tzar<br>
    Or, workless, huddled under decks<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Of liners dubbed White Star.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
    For once by instinct led, I chose<br>
    The path of love laid down in Spain.<br>
    Despite misgivings I had naught<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;To lose and everything to gain.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
    On one of Freddie Laker’s planes<br>
    I came down to a sunlit land<br>
    Dotted with blue of private pools—<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Bland luxuries at hand.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
    You were busy on the day<br>
    I first arrived, so free to roam,<br>
    I saw red-breasted birds unlike<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;The robins back at home,<br>
    </p>

    <p>
    And signs that threatened violators<br>
    Would be towed, or indicated<br>
    Shelters if the BOMB should fall<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;And all else be checkmated.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
    “Is this Illyria lady? “No,<br>
    Come with me now to Walden Pond,<br>
    And then I’ll show you Rockport’s coast,<br>
    And in the night we’ll seal a bond<br>
    That makes you more than tourist in my land.”<br>
    </p>

    <p>
    And so I settled down in this your land:<br>
    An ever-changing city, open to the sea<br>
    And its attendant coves and islands.<br>
    Blest with a late engendered son, our life’s<br>
    Barometer erroneously set fair,<br>
    We soon became aware of academe’s<br>
    Intrigues and had to move, though loath,<br>
    Inland, where much was alien to us both.<br>

    <h2>Evansville, Indiana</h2>
    <p>
    ‘The Crossroads of America’ the state<br>
    Proclaims itself, with all that that entails:<br>
    Migrating people north and south, or freight<br>
    A-sidling west on former forest trails.<br>
    In Evansville the names of streets betray<br>
    The origin of some who settled here<br>
    Until a war in Europe swept away<br>
    Their schools and made a culture disappear,<br>
    Or rather almost vanish: for fhe <i>Männechor</i><br>
    Bears witness to <i>Germania</i> and sounds<br>
    Out its heritage adding to the store<br>
    Of music-making in the city’s bounds,<br>
    Where <i>Kindermusik</i> for our son would lead to more,<br>
    Much more, than ever we had hoped or bargained for.<br>

    <h2>The Choice</h2>
    <p>
    Lately returned from one more visit to my north<br>
    I view the photo of myself improbably<br>
    Atop Owd Isaac Ball’s mid forties old steam-roller.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
    Beyond the show ground, Bowland’s softly curving slopes<br>
    Seduce me to a time of schoolboy cycle rides<br>
    Through dales and moors and back to well-imagined plains.<br>
    My oldest friend drives home through villages and fields.<br>
    I glimpse the grammar school in Kirkham, peer down<br>
    Wesham’s Garstang Road and see a mother hand<br>
    Her son a piece of homemade cake across the wall at playtime.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
    Such images are more than merely salvage from the past,<br>
    Within me, they confirm the Fylde’s my land while life shall last.<br>

    <h2>Envoi</h2>
    <p>
    Even as I choose my childhood’s place<br>
    I know that in the garden you lurked there<br>
    And only granted me a five-year space<br>
    Of blessed ignorance before I’d share<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;The deadly knowledge that you bear.<br>
