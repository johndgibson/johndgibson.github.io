        At seven years old the boy was sent to lodge<br>
        With a childless family of a sect unknown<br>
        To him. There was no way for him to dodge<br>
        The strictures of the tribe: he must disown<br>
        The cheery current song, the <em>Lambeth Walk</em>,<br>
        And sing but hymns upon the good Lord's Day.<br>
        Each morning after grace they'd start to talk<br>
        About a random Bible text and pray<br>
        To Him depicted in the entrance hall:<br>
        A single entriangled eye<br>
        Brooding above his creatures' rise and fall &mdash;<br>
        More fall than rise &mdash; a world that is awry<br>
        And is so still and was so in the past;<br>
        Sorry for the commonplace into which I lapsed.<br>
