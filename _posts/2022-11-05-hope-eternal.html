    <p>
        My loved one's been in exile far too long;<br>
        Out of sight, but never out of mind.<br>
        And though this next step moves her near,<br>
        She's still confined away from me and home.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        This parted couple wish the final step<br>
        Will quickly come to bring us back to where<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We both should ever be.<br>
    </p>
