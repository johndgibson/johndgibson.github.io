    <p>
        A scheming prince who in another time<br>
        Would almost certainly have found a place<br>
        In Oxford's laddish club for toffs, the crime<br>
        He'd once concealed, filed as an unsolved case,<br>
        En route through London's thronging streets<br>
        Noisy with feigned or unfeigned acclamation,<br>
        Hopes to negate a usurping father's feats<br>
        By his forthcoming chruch-blest coronation.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        But look, he's stopped and turned aside<br>
        To quell uproarious former friends, outface<br>
        The cheerful, fat old man and snidely chide<br>
        His failing powers with implied commonplace<br>
        Of doubtful provenance.  For who dares boast<br>
        Of being wise by living longer than the most?<br>
