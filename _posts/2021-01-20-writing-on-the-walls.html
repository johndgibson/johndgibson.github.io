    <p>
        Babylon, the Persians and the Medes:<br>
        A writing in hand invokes a king's downfall<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a mysterious script.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Long lost centuries beyond that fabled feast,<br>
        Sterile hospital walls disturb a woman's<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equilibrium,<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Although the undermining of her mind<br>
        Predates the fort's collapse that led to this<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benign captivity<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Uncontrolled and uncontrollable<br>
        Bloodied words commanding 'kill!' appal<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And horrify.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Each night her two men come for one brief hour<br>
        To talk and listen for tones that might lend hope<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sure delivery,<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Like all of us she may have well been weighed<br>
        In putative and measuring scales which do<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not find her wanting.<br>
    </p>
