        After an oceanic voyage once ashore<br>
        The earth may seem to slip away<br>
        If only for a moment.  Soon the core<br>
        Of balance reasserts its easy sway.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        In the fifties in my uni we<br>
        Would hold a yearly do to amuse<br>
        The faculty with filthy jokes and off key<br>
        Songs fuelled both by too much booze.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Afterwards, bikers hazardously tried,<br>
        To miss the staggerers.  Two days later<br>
        You might see former revellers side<br>
        By side studying to please a bourgeois pater.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Not all stumbling leads to falling badly.<br>
        Sometimes chance fortuitously is involved<br>
        As after a marriage that had ended sadly<br>
        I stumbled on a woman who quickly solved<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My self-inflicted woes!<br>
    </p>
