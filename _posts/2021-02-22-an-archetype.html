    <p>
        Minimal hair loss, classically white,<br>
        Afflicted with matutinal shakes<br>
        And condemned to meditate at night<br>
        On death. Sleepless and afraid, he takes<br>
        A pill prescribed to shoo away anxiety,<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        And turns to memory in the hope to kill<br>
        The thoughts of nothingness to come,<br>
        Which only brings him to another hill<br>
        Unscalable, despite the fife and drum<br>
        Bands psalming to indoctrinate.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        But now it's daytime, brightly blue, post snow<br>
        And yet o signal of the heat to follow.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The expat stokes his fiery rant<br>
        Against the trumpers and their cant<br>
        And reaps the plaudits of his friends.<br>

    <p>
        Examining his life from aged heights<br>
        He Remembers his discomfort faced<br>
        With multiplying and dividing fractions;<br>
        He would rather read about the actions<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Of King Arthur and his knights.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        But numbers and stories together create delights;<br>
        While frights that can beset us, are sometimes chased<br>
        Away by reason or by new distractions,<br>
        Ignoring or subduing political factions,<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Trusting only the mind's lights.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        This facile self discounts the negatives<br>
        Till a computer saps his confidence<br>
        By denying access to the internet.<br>
        The worst is yet to come: he phones to get<br>
        Assistance from the number given and spends<br>
        A pointless afternoon changing passwords<br>
        That don't work. After giving up,<br>
        He calls his techie son;<br>
        Ten minutes later all is done!<br>
