        Doddering through the outskirts of a seat<br>
        Of learning, the old codger is bemused.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        These buildings and redoubts of burnished brick<br>
        Are not congruent with his imagining<br>
        Of sandstone that is more than just a trick<br>
        Of memory.  This he has culled from years<br>
        Of visiting the place.<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet this misfit<br>
        Gels with empty pockets that provoke<br>
        Another worry &mdash; how to pay the bus<br>
        Fare to get home.  He gazes to his right<br>
        And sees idyllic pastures and still waters<br>
        And wonders why he should need any cash,<br>
        Since he came by car, a thought that drags<br>
        Unwelcome knowledge from below now troubled<br>
        Waters: doctor Iqbal has forbidden him to drive!<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Bamboozled yet again he trudges on<br>
        And wonders if there'll be one more surprise.<br>
        No sooner thought than done: a vehicle<br>
        Slows down beside him, the driver leans<br>
        Towards him, offers him a lift<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To Castle Hedingham.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        "Ah," he sighs, "this Cambridge cannot be<br>
        In Massachusetts.  Yet it's hardly Cambridge,<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; England!<br>
