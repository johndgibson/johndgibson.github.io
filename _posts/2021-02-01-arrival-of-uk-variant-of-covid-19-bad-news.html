        &nbsp; &nbsp; It's not the first time Britain's sent<br>
        Unwanted entities to this far continent.<br>
        Even before that fabled year of 1620,<br>
        The Brits had tried with scant success<br>
        To see if they might profit and so steer<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; Themselves to credal realms of progress.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        The myth would have us think that native tribes<br>
        Had made the so-called pilgrims welcome.  Soon<br>
        They would learn the hard way that no bribes<br>
        Of any kind would save them from their fate:<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; Deceived with broken words and faced<br>
        With guns and horses, they became displaced.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        And British slavers vied with other lands<br>
        To subjugate black Africans to toil<br>
        In cotton fields to satisfy the money lust.<br>
        Small wonder that these same exploiters soon<br>
        Would turn against their kith and kin to kill<br>
        The tribute loyalists paid to England still.<br>
