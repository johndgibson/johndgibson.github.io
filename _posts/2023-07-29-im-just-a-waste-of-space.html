    <p>
        You are not the first or only one<br>
        To denigrate yourself, in such a way.<br>
        Nor is it necessary to speculate upon<br>
        The reason why such deprecations are<br>
        Not uncommon.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that your ancient lover needs<br>
        To do is reassure you that our love endures<br>
        And that he's fortunate to live with such<br>
        A kind and loving wife.<br>
    </p>
