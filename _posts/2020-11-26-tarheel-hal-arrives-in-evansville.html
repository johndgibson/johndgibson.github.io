        <p>
            Cattle no longer graze the fields that spanned<br>
            Two north-western English Villages<br>
            Lush grass kept green by the unfailing rain<br>
            Gave place to concrete of a runway planned<br>
            To take the planes built in the USA.<br>
            A few yards down our lane, a field gate<br>
            Beneath the flight path of incoming planes<br>
            Would tempt a boy to interrupt his play<br>
            And climb to watch close up the latest plane<br>
            Circle round the Ribble losing height<br>
            Before it roared overhead to make<br>
            A perfect landing, while in the lane,<br>
            The boy, who'd learned to number B and P<br>
            Identified this as a Thunderbolt &mdash;<br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; P 47.<br>
            Much vaunted for its high kill rate<br>
            Of Messerschmitts and Zeroes.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            More than seventy years beyond that war,<br>
            In Evansville, where many Thunderbolts<br>
            Were made, the local paper has, above<br>
            The headline heralding the arrival of<br>
            The quaintly named Tarheel Hal,<br>
            A photo of a Thunderbolt, dolled out<br>
            With stripy underwings of black and white.<br>
            While, protruding from a fuselage<br>
            Of blue, the nose is encircled red and yellow,<br>
            Hues appropriate for peaceful times,<br>
            Unlike the camouflage of yester years.<br>
