        "Come on the Pool," I'd shout at home games<br>
        On Bloomfield Road, much to my dad's chagrin.<br>
        "You were born in Preston.  You should support<br>
        North End not Blackpool."<br>

        From our upstairs window near the Irish Sea<br>
        On rare clear days we'd see in muted grey<br>
        And green the uplift of the Bowland Hills,<br>
        An easy cycle ride to breath a purer air.<br>

        Not a mountain in the Rockies, yet<br>
        Ingleborough in the English north<br>
        Seemed more than a mere hill, whose cap<br>
        Of millstone grit enticed me to the top.<br>

    <p>
        Directly east of my boyhood's Fylde,<br>
        University College Hull, despite<br>
        My pitiful HSC results, enrolled<br>
        Me to study for a general BA.<br>

        In those now distant days a Nissen hut<br>
        Divided into four gave me it seemed<br>
        Unequalled privilege &mdash; a single bed,<br>
        A wardrobe, table, chairs and a kettle!<br>

        A teacher I became and found in every class<br>
        A swot or two who might beguile unthinking<br>
        Teachers, though not I, who recognised<br>
        The simple truth: do not play favourites.<br>

        Twice married &mdash; and twice jilted &mdash; my daughter<br>
        Bade me go to Spain where, on St. James's<br>
        Day, before his church in Compostela,<br>
        I chanced upon her who has favoured me<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For more than thirty years.<br>
