    <p>
        To make this day mean more than just<br>
        An idle ritual we need to think<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;About our son, a man of worth.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Wise in the world's ways his diligence<br>
        Brought him success, but best of all he cares<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;And shows his love for her who gave<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Him so much care and love.<br>
    </p>
