    <p>
        The last day of Novermber's brought slight snow<br>
        That does not coat our world nor will not last.<br>
        Last night again our chat began to flow<br>
        Towards the doings of my distant past.<br>
        Your questions led me to remembered joy<br>
        Of visits to Kirkham's co-op cinema.<br>
        The first film that I saw as a little boy:<br>
        <em>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.</em>  A<br>
        Memory of the dwarves' daft working song,<br>
        Although with rhyming words changed naughtily<br>
        Some time in my teenage years; a gong<br>
        That shows rejection of my past most haughtily.<br>
        My question to the mirror on the wall?<br>
        Who can tell me truly if I have a soul??<br>
