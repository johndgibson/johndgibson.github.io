        Although, in common with just about every teacher since the Second World War
        trained in England and Wales, I was examined in the philosophy of education, I cannot
        claim to have been influenced by Rousseau, Spenser, Dewey or Montessori – at least as
        far as I can tell. As for educational psychology, I developed a healthy scepticism towards
        intelligence testing that was later borne out by the revelations of Spearman’s dubious
        research. By and large, I share the cynical view of many who have taken education
        courses that they are of little practical worth. Twelve weeks teaching practice and the
        advice of practicing teachers coupled with memories of my harassment of weak teachers
        in my tear away times served to get my career off to a sound empirical start. Within a
        year or two, I had formulated one or two maxims of my own. Foremost among these was
        the dictum, based on the quasi-Socratic notion that the road to failure is paved with
        teachers pretending to knowledge when faced with a question they could not honestly
        answer, “Don’t be afraid to admit you don’t know.” It’s more than likely that my
        recognition of this truism owes something to the fact that I had failed some O and A level
        exams. From this source too must come my second major given that any class of students
        is going to contain someone who is potentially smarter that oneself. I suspect that both
        these principles were subconsciously with me the first time I entered the fifth form
        classroom in De Aston School, Market Rasen in September 1954.
    </p>
    <p>
        My pedagogical theory then seems to have been present from the very beginning,
        and so was my practice, though I was slower to acknowledge the formative influence of
        the biology teacher, Bernard Stevenson, in my schooldays at Kirkham Grammar School
        Lancashire. It was to be many years later before I came to realize that my style and
        classroom practice owed much to his love of the sound of English which led him to
        pronounce the technical vocabulary of his subject as if he were reciting Marlowe’s
        mighty lines – “the external morphology of an herbaceous flowering plant” was his first
        dramatically delivered utterance. He would also sprinkle his lessons with quotations from
        the Authorised Version and Shakespeare. Which is, I now think, the origin of my own
        love of quotation. When after several years of teaching I found myself telling my sixth
        form literature class that the words “appearance and reality” were written in letters of
        flame a mile high above the blackboard and that the answer to many a question regarding
        Shakespearean themes was located there, I heard again the accents and gestures of
        Bernard Stevenson making the same point with regard to biological concepts and the
        word “surface”.
    </p>
    <p>
        Long before the realization of my debt to Bernard Stevenson, I was taught a
        valuable lesson by a member of the awkward squad at that small boys’ grammar school
        in rural Lincolnshire where I made my teaching debut. This lesson became my third
        criterion in my dealings with pupils. The school had a boarding house of fifty or so boys,
        many of whom were the sons of servicemen stationed in the airfields that dated back to
        the days of the great raids on Germany and occupied Europe during the Second World
        War. Among these boarders was a fine-looking, fair-haired stripling of fifteen, Tommy
        Anderson, who was generally acknowledged to be a bright lad. He was also a
        troublemaker. I remember him sitting towards the back of the class, across the aisle from
        a cheerful farmer’s son from the wolds who was as much a troublemaker as he was, but
        more open about it and therefore more easily dealt with. Tommy’s specialty was
        muttering smart-alec remarks so sotto voce that they were barely audible. His natural
        fluency ensured that his written work showed great promise, but it always had an offhand
        quality about it, as if to say, “I know what you want from me, but I’ll be damned if I’m
        going to oblige.” Apparently he managed in all his school subjects to get by with the
        minimum of effort. He might have made an ideal Jacobean malcontent, if I had broken
        with tradition and produced The White Devil or The Duchess of Malfi instead of the
        headmasterly prescribed Shakespearean play.
    </p>
    <p>
        In those early days when educational texts were full of the polemics of nature
        versus nature, I was a strong partisan of education as a major determinant of individual
        and social change, being possessed by the idea that the New Jerusalem could be built
        through understanding, tolerance and the universal provision of opportunity. Animated by
        this spirit, I determined to pluck the brand Tommy Anderson from the burning. An
        occasion presented itself sometime towards the end of the first term of my first year. In
        addition to refereeing, umpiring and accompanying school teams to away games, one of
        the extra-mural duties of a master at De Aston School was the supervision of boarders’
        prep from six o’clock to half past seven two or three nights a term. On one such night, I
        was walking down the corridor from the staff room when I met young Anderson. I cannot
        remember exactly what I said to him, but I must have made an offer to help him in some
        way, and perhaps suggested that he was always welcome to discuss any problems with
        me (the rumour was that his parents had just divorced). Whatever it was, it produced a
        caustic response from him: “I don’t need you to be my psychiatrist.” These words, which
        immediately revealed to me my own naïveté, became a guiding principle for the rest of
        my teaching career – until recently.
    </p>
    <p>
        To be labeled a teacher’s pet was a terrible indictment when I was a schoolboy
        and though the vocabulary may change over time and place, the concept still carries with
        it the scorn of one’s peers. The corresponding sin on the part of the teacher is, of course,
        playing favourites. To avoid playing favourites the teacher has to recognize that liking
        some people and disliking others is as much a feature of the classroom as it is of any
        social situation. If you acknowledge this, you have a chance of discounting your personal
        feelings in the interest of fairness. Anderson’s remark reminded me strongly of this home
        truth. But it also went further than the mere avoidance of playing favourites.
    </p>
    <p>
        By the time of the move towards comprehensive education, I had moved via the
        east Riding of Yorkshire to what would prove to be my last English employment in
        Suffolk. The problems that accompanied that radical shift in English education brought a
        corresponding shift in the traditional role of teachers, especially for those who came out
        of the grammar schools. Teachers centered in their academic disciplines were
        increasingly being asked to be counselors and social workers, and some teachers of
        English of the school of David Holbrook even went so far as to aspire to the role of
        psychiatrists! One example will show what I mean. In the early 1960s, the daughter of an
        elderly well-known man of letters was asked to write an essay with the title, “In Spite of,
        Not Because…” Needless to say, with the words of Tommy Anderson still ringing in my
        ears, I was not sympathetic to this example of Holbrookian pedagogy. Teachers of
        English were at that time especially prone to such practice, perhaps because their subject
        matter &mdash; literature and the teaching of writing &mdash; involves the affective as much as the
        analytic. Against this tendency I urged that teachers should leave the inner life of their
        students to those more competent to deal with it.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, my sense that teachers ought to stick to what the agent noun implies –
        teaching, the imparting of knowledge and the development of skills – is not so doctrinaire
        as to overlook the fact that successful teaching involves personal relationships and that in
        the course of teaching the teacher is dealing with the whole range of human personality,
        and therefore needs to be sensitive to individual differences and difficulties. Over the
        years I have known one or two students who came to me in moments of personal crisis
        such as a bereavement or an unlooked for pregnancy. In each case, I was surprised at the
        confidence and had certainly not sought it. Nor would I claim that I had any expertise
        beyond the common ability to lend a sympathetic ear and offer advice based on my
        experience of coping with stress in my own life. I think of these instances as arising out
        of the day-to-day interactions of the classroom or other school activities such as drama
        and choral singing. What it is that induces a young person to turn to this teacher rather
        than that one is something I am not interested in investigating, but when I think of myself
        as a student rather than a teacher (and I have been fortunate enough to have been a formal
        student three times in my mature years), I know that the teachers I might have confided in
        were precisely those who were outstanding in what they did professionally. Such master
        teachers acquire disciples without trying. Two master teachers for me were Bernard
        Stevenson in my middle teens and Russ Hart of the English Department of the University
        of Massachusetts in my late fifties. The latter’s seminar on life writing made the same
        impact on me as Bernard Stevenson’s classes on evolution and genetics for non-scientific
        sixth-formers had made.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is time to turn from distinguished teachers to distinguished students, for it is
        they who present a challenge to the principle of not playing favourites and make it
        difficult to keep the relationship purely professional. The problem exists more at the
        tertiary than the secondary level of education, as I have found out in the last fifteen years’
        teaching in American colleges and universities.
    </p>
    <p>
        The intensive nature of the American college system with its night classes and
        summer sessions attracts a considerable number of mature students, and it these that often
        prove to be the best and most interesting students and therefore the ones posing most
        threats to the objectivity of the teacher. In 1991 in the first semester of my work at the
        University of Southern Indiana I encountered such a mature student in my English 101
        (Rhetoric and Composition: Critical Thinking) night-class. She was a woman in her late
        forties with children of her own at university. She came from a rural German-American
        community that had grown up around an opencast coalmine and, until being made
        redundant earlier in the year, she herself had been a miner. This fact alone was sufficient
        to arouse my interest. According to her own account, she had done but poorly in high
        school. The first essay she turned in was the work of a natural (so much for my
        championing of nurture!). I made one or two minor corrections of punctuation and
        spelling and wrote a suitably laudatory comment. When she read my comments she was
        astounded and stayed after class to tell me that her English teacher of many years ago had
        more or less said that she couldn’t write. During the course of the semester she would
        write essays that revealed herself to be well-informed about the world in general and well
        aware of the narrow prejudiced world of her own family and community. She was
        someone who could have become a friend. But night-class ends at a quarter to nine and
        she, like many another student, had a drive of more than forty miles home, so my
        professional integrity remained intact.
    </p>
    <p>
        It has been otherwise in the case of Ken Webern. I first became aware of Ken
        three years ago when he enrolled in my Humanities 212 (The Western Tradition in the
        Humanities: the Renaissance to the Twentieth Century) class. This required course often
        presents the teacher with a roomful of students who would rather be elsewhere, but in this
        class I realised that there was at least one student who would get something out of it. Ken
        is a powerful presence, well over six feet, bulky, yet with the gait of a natural athlete,
        which is what he had been in his youth. He has intimidated younger teachers, but he
        found my Englishness congenial and responded enthusiastically to canonical texts. Since
        then he has taken two other courses with me, most recently, an interdisciplinary seminar
        on the First World War and its consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have given this course three times now, but this is the first time that the class has
        contained so many mature students &mdash; five out of sixteen, of whom three, including Ken,
        had served in combat units in Vietnam. One of the Vietnam vets is, like Ken, a natural
        writer. He is also orally fluent and an extrovert. A mature talented female student of the
        same generation as the vets was active in the anti-war protests of the sixties and early
        seventies. Despite the presence of good twenty-something-year old students in the class
        and my own efforts to encourage everyone to participate, it was inevitable that the older
        students dominated discussion. As may be imagined the presence of the vets in such a
        course made the experience memorable for me. Their identification with the soldiers of
        that war of my father’s generation meant that they responded with sympathy and
        understanding to the television documentary, literature, films and art I used in the course.
    </p>
    <p>
        Several members of the liberal arts faculty knew the vets and so I was well
        informed as to their ability, as well as their personal problems. I had, of course, known
        Ken from previous classes. The twice-weekly class ended just before lunch. After the ten
        minutes or so of dealing with individual students’ questions, I would step into the
        corridor to find Ken in animated conversation with one of the students. He would ask me
        half-apologetically if I was having lunch and if so could he discuss some aspect of the
        work with me. Occasionally, the two other vets would join us, but usually I would lunch
        with Ken alone. Sooner or later the talk would turn towards his experience of the horrors
        of landing a helicopter on a mountain LZ (landing zone) under fire, of the fear of the
        dawn and the need to postpone its coming in methodical drinking. And so I learned of the
        drinking problem, which was in danger of destroying his marriage and which drove him
        to a planned suicide and ultimately to the realization that he needed psychiatric
        counseling. As he described how even now, thirty years later, he dreaded going to bed for
        with sleep came the ever-recurring nightmares, he reminded me of Edmund Blunden’s
        remark made in his seventies that no night came without his hearing the guns of Flanders.
        Not that all our conversation turned on war. We shared experiences of our early lives and
        noted how we both found that Wordsworth’s Immortality Ode struck similar chords and
        then, in response to his growing passion for the poetry of Sassoon and Owen, I broke all
        my own rules by giving him a copy of my favourite edition of Owen’s poetry. Worse, I
        suggested that I give him a reading list of non-war literature, on the theme of childhood,
        perhaps.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thus it was that I realized I had made a friend of a student while &mdash; and this is the
        telling point &mdash; he was still a student and that Tommy Anderson might somewhere be
        sardonically observing my feeble efforts to play the healer.
