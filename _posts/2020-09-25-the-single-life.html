            The single and peculiar life is bound<br>
            With all the strength and armour of the mind<br>
            To keep itself from noyance.<br>

        Anyone who is a dissident<br>
        Undoubtedly would give assent<br>
        To this injunction so self-evident,<br>
        Even though it lacks a supplement:<br>
        That what is done should be done without intent<br>
        To bring annoyance to another gent<br>
        Or woman!<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Moreover, context gives one pause<br>
        For Thought: a two timing self-server speaks<br>
        These lines to benefit the murderous king.<br>
