        After his wife's death, he would disparage<br>
        The urging of his friends to send his pair<br>
        Of lads into the local orphanage,<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For he meant well.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        He even went to Ireland where he'd met<br>
        A lass he'd rather fancied in the war;<br>
        Perhaps she'd take him on.  No go that bet,<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Despite his meaning well.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        A jilted woman working as a mother<br>
        At the Children's Home became his wife.<br>
        He was her second best; she saw no other.<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And she meant well.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Her decision came with strict demands:<br>
        The C of E and alcohol must be<br>
        Adjured, replaced by Methodist commands.<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; More meaning well!<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        My father's mug of tea had to be strong,<br>
        If not, it would be damned as "Methodist tea."<br>
        Which clearly put the maker in the wrong;<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Countering her meaning well.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Eventually the family added two<br>
        More boys &mdash; "her two and my two" said the man.<br>
        "No girls! then boys must lean like girls to do.<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The woman spoke her meaning well.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        The eldest peeled the spuds for Sunday's lunch<br>
        And did the washing-up.  Dropping a cup,<br>
        His clumsiness would earn a well-aimed punch,<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although he'd meant well.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        All told the marriage was a bumpy ride;<br>
        Made worse by number three son's wiliness<br>
        To weep at will and plausibly to lie,<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For he meant ill.<br>
    </p>
