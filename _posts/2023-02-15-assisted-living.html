    <p>
        The rounded belly brings to light its fruit<br>
        That bawls in protest at its sundering from<br>
        The fleshy comfort of the womb.<br>
        A mother's breast is the first and foremost<br>
        There, although a bottle with its powdered<br>
        Liquid more than merely helps to satisfy<br>
        The childish wish to stay alive.<br>

        The present world requires a child to read.<br>
        In a small council school in Lancashire<br>
        Two sister teachers, Phyliss and Miss Kirby,<br>
        Set us to work on Moses in the bulrushes.<br>
        The story's told as we roll our plasticine to form<br>
        His basket ready for the Pharaoh's inspection.<br>

        Sunday's the day when Catholics and Protestants<br>
        Ensure their children get a push<br>
        Along the road to right religious truth.<br>
        Know-all sceptics stigmatise such guidance<br>
        As nothing more than blatant brainwashing.<br>

        At secondary school the lucky lads are taught<br>
        By a teacher of biology<br>
        Who clearly loves the language of his craft:<br>
        And makes his students heed his concepts<br>
        By the music of his sentences.<br>

        Across the UK, Hull's new university<br>
        Allowed the skiving student to get by<br>
        And graduate while dabbling fitfully<br>
        In student politics and moping mournfully<br>
        In Cupid's tempting kingdom.<br>

        The world's his oyster so some said as he<br>
        Embarked upon a lifelong teaching English<br>
        Literature, encouraged by a few<br>
        Well-meaning folk.<br>

        Old age has brought the real McCoy: one flat<br>
        Above a ground floor one that separates<br>
        A man and wife who manage to meet over<br>
        Three ample meals a day.<br>
