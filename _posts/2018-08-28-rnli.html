    <p>
        A visit to my northern land<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; Is incomplete without<br>
        A call at Lythamâ€™s lifeboat post<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; For a shopping bout:<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        A ball point pen, a greeting card<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; A towel or flashlight<br>
        With images emblazoned that bring<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; Other scenes in sight.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Such as a classroom print of brave<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; Grace Darling, who with no star<br>
        To guide, rowed to reach a ship<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; Broken on Big Harcar.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        In peace and war the lifeboats<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; Still my island serve<br>
        Rescuing rich and heedless ones<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; Who otherwise might get what they deserve.<br>
    </p>
