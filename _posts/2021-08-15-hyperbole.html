        And yes these words will not for long hold sway<br>
        As Edgar lives to see their contradiction:<br>
        His father blinded, brought to 'smell his way<br>
        To Dover.' Nor has any interdiction<br>
        Uprooted man's inhumanity to man.<br>
        And though some glory in our control<br>
        Of nature's world, such braggadocio can<br>
        Not hide the damage now and still to fall.<br>
        Regardless of afflictions brought about<br>
        By ethnic and by clannish prejudice,<br>
        A mental torment hard as any clout<br>
        Can shove a body to the precipice,<br>
        As when I heard a woman, physically fit,<br>
        Repeatedly aver that life for her is shit.<br>
