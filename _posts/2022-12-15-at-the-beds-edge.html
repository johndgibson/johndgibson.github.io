    <p>
        Within the slightly curled up flesh and bone<br>
        Your mind rejects your man's attempt to lead<br>
        You back to our first loving dawn.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        I sit upon the bed and gaze and gaze upon<br>
        Your lovely face and golden hair and stop<br>
        Myself from clasping you as in the days long gone:<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        While more than once you look at me<br>
        And say "I'm sorry John," which only makes<br>
        Me wonder what or who can make you free.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Even in your own distress you show your love<br>
        For me, our son and all our friends.  Were I<br>
        A praying man, I'd curse the powers that be<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        For failing to ensure that you who do<br>
        No harm should never shake so cruelly.<br>
    </p>
