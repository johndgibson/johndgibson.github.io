Written in blank verse, sonnet, ballad stanza and terza rima (among others), this collection of formalist poetry
spans John's six chapbooks and other selections of published and unpublished poems.

<blockquote>
    “What especially strikes me about [John's poems] is the way that they
    virtually all start with something very specific - a landscape, a memory, an anecdote - which is recorded with
    meticulous care and accuracy, so that we have a strong visual impression of the ‘facts’ that John is talking about,
    and then almost imperceptibly they begin to embody something wider and more general, something human and humane,
    which a reader with wholly different life-experiences can share and enter into.”

<blockquote>
    "For thirty-two years, at all times of day or night, I have watched
    my husband writing poems.  He chooses a subject, a form, a tonality.
    He searches for rhyming words and fights to constrain his thought
    to a chosen pattern.  I have lived with his frustration and delight.
    Penning poetry defines what and who he is.  For family and friends
    in the old world and the new, he is our father, our uncle, our mate
    and our poet."
