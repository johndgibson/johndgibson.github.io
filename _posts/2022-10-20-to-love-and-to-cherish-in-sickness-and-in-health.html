    <p>
        This forced unwanted separation tests<br>
        And strengthens what we promised all those years<br>
        Ago.  Although we find it hard to bear<br>
        Your move to a ward beyond an easy reach<br>
        We hope it may restore you to yourself.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Meanwhile we trust the doctors may yet find<br>
        An efficacious medication that will<br>
        Steer you to a clear and simple path<br>
        To tread and I shall gladly take your arm<br>
        And stay with you till death us do part.<br>
    </p>
