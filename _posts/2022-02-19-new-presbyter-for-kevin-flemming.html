        Let's not forget that ugly rumpus stirred<br>
        Up by Crowell's lot in England (not to speak<br>
        Of Wales or Scotland, Ireland, Germany<br>
        Or France) nor all that killing one another <br>
        On religious, or maybe economic grounds?<br>

        Three centuries beyond that most uncivil strife,<br>
        A puritanical stepmother bound<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Me to the Methodists despite<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;My Church of England's baptism.<br>

        Small wonder then that I would waste my time<br>
        At Hull's new redbrick university<br>
        By trying all the town's disparate sects,<br>
        From quiet Quakerdom to rites of Rome.<br>

    <p>
        An ocean and a world away from all<br>
        That needles tribulation, I found<br>
        Myself following a late-born singing son<br>
        Across our standard mis-west town<br>
        To undermine John Milton's adage that<br>
        'New presbyter is but old priest writ large.'<br>
