    <p>
        You staged your death some thirty years away<br>
        From here; returning now you're forcing me<br>
        To compensate for my refusal to see<br>
        Your corpse on your Welsh funeral day.<br>
        Haunted by what you did I have to try<br>
        To recreate your body hanging in<br>
        That empty room and wonder if the sin<br>
        Was yours or ours that brought you there to die?<br>
        And wonder too just what was going through your mind<br>
        Accumulating three things for your plot &mdash;<br>
        The rope and hook and standing point &mdash; groping to find<br>
        A beam and learning to tie the hangman's knot.<br>
        None of this would undermine your demands,<br>
        As you were known for being good with your hands.<br>
    </p>
