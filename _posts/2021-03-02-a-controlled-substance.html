    <p>
        I know what some of you are thinking:<br>
        'Another liberal with his plea<br>
        For smoking bloody pot to<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Decriminalised.'<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        But you'd be wrong. For stumbling through<br>
        My hoard of words I sometimes think<br>
        Of meanings that may interlink<br>
        With origins now nullified.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Long ago in Latin class<br>
        When asked to analyse one word<br>
        (And woe betide us if we erred)<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;We'd freeze quite petrified.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Eventually the teacher would<br>
        Himself be forced to explicate<br>
        What we had failed to penetrate,<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;However much we tried.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Who needs a scholar now to teach<br>
        Us what 'sub' means? And though 'stance'<br>
        Is not obscure, the dual dance<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;May leave one mystified<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Leaving aside the usual definition<br>
        Of substance, down that road I will not blunder<br>
        But take its Latin sense of <em>standing under</em><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;With all that is implied.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Accepting this, I need to change<br>
        'Controlled' into 'controlling,' though<br>
        What I do and who I am I owe<br>
        to substance &mdash; still unspecified.<br>
    </p>
