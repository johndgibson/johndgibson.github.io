        What does a brickie need to get the wall<br>
        Exactly right? Besides well-fired bricks<br>
        And rudimentary training in the tricks<br>
        Of the trade, a clear eye and a steady hand.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        And what of last century's mill-bound weavers?<br>
        Cotton from east and west and hills of coal<br>
        To power looms; above the din they call<br>
        And lip read what the tackler says.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Every dwelling place if it's to thrive<br>
        Needs carers to prodigiously expend<br>
        Their energy on chores &mdash; to clean and shop and tend<br>
        The children and the sick and keep the love alive.<br>

        In this our scientific age, we trust<br>
        That experts will be able to resolve<br>
        Those common problems that may well involve,<br>
        If not afflict, mere ordinary mortals.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        "Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased?"<br>
        Macbeth's question stayed unanswered then,<br>
        But may be answered now. "A course of<br>
        ECT may do the trick. But if<br>
        It doesn't we can try a different set<br>
        Of pills you've had before." "And when these<br>
        Fail?" "We'll substitute this pill for that."
