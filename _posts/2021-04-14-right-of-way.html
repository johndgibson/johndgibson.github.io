    <p>
        A single road driver yesterday<br>
        Began to nose out on to our highway,<br>
        Causing us to swerve and so precipitate<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A three-car pile-up.<br>
        That lousy driver would have been OK<br>
        In nineteen fifties France where I soon learned,<br>
        A few miles from the ferry, traffic entering<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the right had right of way.<br>

        Some time ago, in my naivet√©<br>
        I thought that wedding Mary would fulfil<br>
        My dream of matrimonial bliss, until,<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With barely any delay,<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She found a right of way<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into my brother's bed.<br>
    </p>

        It's twittering times here in the USA.<br>
        Where office holders swear an oath to keep<br>
        The constitution. Recently, to much dismay<br>
        A president has claimed the right of way<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do as he thinks fit.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Despite attempts to overthrow results<br>
        Of an election, steadfast people chose<br>
        To assert the democratic way.<br>
