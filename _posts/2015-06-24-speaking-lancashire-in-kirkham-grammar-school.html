    <p>
        Scholarship boys speaking the dialect,<br>
        But learning subconsciously modified vowels,<br>
        Yet never quite mastering their betters’ RP,<br>
        Were humbled and felt it deep in the bowels<br>
        While striving to hang on to selfhood &mdash; DV,<br>
        Yet subtly acquiring a passable idiolect.<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; e.g.<br>
        Clogger Clegg’s son trying to concentrate<br>
        Was stopped in mid-sentence by master Slim Price<br>
        For a linguistic fault of failing to aspirate<br>
        Horse, hare and hound and so had to say twice:<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        “He hit me on the head with a heavy hammer.”
