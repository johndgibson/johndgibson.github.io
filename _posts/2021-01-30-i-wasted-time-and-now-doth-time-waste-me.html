    <p>
        For the structured life &mdash; by school and work<br>
        Or family obligation &mdash; passing time<br>
        Is not a pressing issue, nor for those<br>
        Devoted to a conjured holy cause.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        A life alone my satisfy both saints<br>
        And sinners, even those especial blokes<br>
        Who frequent country pubs to sit alone<br>
        And watch the scene with an infrequent groan.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        And then of course the nature lovers led<br>
        By Wordsworth wish for nothing better than<br>
        A solitary walk across the hills<br>
        Of England bare of its satanic mills.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Unsought solitude implies a man<br>
        Or Woman all alone by choice or chance,<br>
        The former's rare, the latter's often fought<br>
        Against as when one breaks the married dance.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        A variant of problematic solitude<br>
        Is with us now. For we must live confined<br>
        Like soldiers to their barracks and all life<br>
        Is fixed, while streets are sometimes given to strife.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Nature no longer nourishes. The air<br>
        Itself contaminates, as scientists strive<br>
        To immunise us from the raging scourge,<br>
        Leaving us nothing much to sing beyond a dirge.<br>
    </p>

        Meanwhile, what looms each day is what I thought<br>
        About before I got side-tracked by solitude:<br>
        How to pass the time without a norm<br>
        To guide and help us keep a goodly attitude.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        In those first days still hoping for an early end<br>
        We phoned or zoomed our friends and learned<br>
        Of good folks gardening or doing chores.<br>
        All over now, not even socks to mend.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        For me, I seek to keep my mind alive,<br>
        By reading, first my birthday presents, next<br>
        Those unread books upon our shelves,<br>
        And books in French, though here I hardly thrive.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        All the above I think is laudable,<br>
        So too perhaps is my poetic dabbling<br>
        And keeping up with current news, though Netflix<br>
        Is more dubious.  What's the point of all this babbling?<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Mere procrastination, delaying a confession<br>
        Of a struggle with my obsession<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; Of playing online solitaire<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        A waste of time, which replicates the plight<br>
        Of Shakespeare's doomed king.<br>
    </p>
