John Gibson was born in Preston, Lancashire in 1931. His first years coincided with the depression, in which his father who worked in the cotton mills of Lancashire lost his job. John’s beloved mother died in the flu epidemic of 1937. Educated at Kirkham Grammar School and the University of Hull, John became an English teacher. In 1983 John took early retirement and taught English in the summer of 1984 to Spanish children in Santiago de Compostela where he met his future American wife Leslie Roberts. After a year’s teaching in Seville, he moved to the United States where he taught at the college level in Boston, before moving to the mid-west with his wife, where they both taught at the University of Southern Indiana in Evansville. John has a daughter, Rebecca, in England and a son, Ben, in the United States.
